# Python practice programs:

[**python_practice_1.py**](https://github.com/RocktimRajkumar/Python_Practice/blob/master/python_practice_1.py)

> Create a table with a large number of records (you can find it with a
> google search or use this link -
> https://github.com/datacharmer/test_db). Use MySQL Database.One can
> setup MySQL on localhost. Write some basic queries using python.
> Suppose you want to process/fetch a large number of records using
> python while keeping your memory usage low. Think of approaches on how
> to accomplish this and Implement. Hint: Use Generator

[**python_practice_2.py**](https://github.com/RocktimRajkumar/Python_Practice/blob/master/python_practice_2.py)

>Define a class Person and its two child classes: Male and Female. All classes have a
method &quot;get_gender&quot; which can print &quot;Male&quot; for Male class and &quot;Female&quot; for Female
Class.
Bonus: Make class Person an abstract class and make get_gender an abstract method in the
same class. The two child classes must inherit and implement get_gender. i.,e, When trying to
initialize an object of class Person, the program must throw error.
Hint:
Use abc library (comes natively with Python3) https://www.python-
course.eu/python3_abstract_classes.php

[**python_practice_3.py**](https://github.com/RocktimRajkumar/Python_Practice/blob/master/python_practice_3.py)

> With a given list [12,24,35,24,88,120,155,88,120,155], write a program to print this list
after removing all duplicate values with original order reserved.
Hint: Use set() to store a number of values without duplicates.

[**python_practice_4.py**](https://github.com/RocktimRajkumar/Python_Practice/blob/master/python_practice_4.py)

> Write a program to generate a 3*5*8 3D array whose each element is 0.

[**python_practice_5.py**](https://github.com/RocktimRajkumar/Python_Practice/blob/master/python_practice_5.py)

> Write a binary search function which searches an item in a sorted list. The function
should return the index of element to be searched in the list.

[**python_practice_6.py**](https://github.com/RocktimRajkumar/Python_Practice/blob/master/python_practice_6.py)

> Write a program using generator to print the numbers which can be divisible by 5
and 7 between 0 and n in comma separated form while n is input by console.

[**python_practice_7.py**](https://github.com/RocktimRajkumar/Python_Practice/blob/master/python_practice_7.py)

>Assuming that we have some email addresses in the &quot;username@companyname.com&quot;
format, write a program to print the company name of a given email address. Both user
names and company names are composed of letters only.

[**python_practice_8.py**](https://github.com/RocktimRajkumar/Python_Practice/blob/master/python_practice_8.py)

> Write a program which can map() to make a list whose elements are square of numbers
between 1 and 20 (both included).
Hints:
Use map() to generate a list.
Use Lambda to define anonymous functions.

[**dir_tree.py**](https://github.com/RocktimRajkumar/Python_Practice/blob/master/dir_tree.py)

> Implement a program dir_tree.py that takes a directory as argument and prints all the files
in that directory recursively as a tree.
Hint: Use os.listdir and os.path.isdir functions.

[**python_practice_10.py**](https://github.com/RocktimRajkumar/Python_Practice/blob/master/python_practice_10.py)

> Write an iterator class ReverseIter, that takes a list and iterates it from the reverse
Direction.

[**python_practice_11.py**](https://github.com/RocktimRajkumar/Python_Practice/blob/master/python_practice_11.py)

> Write a program anti_html.py that takes a URL as argument, downloads the html from web
and print it after stripping html tags.
